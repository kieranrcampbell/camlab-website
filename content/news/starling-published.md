Congratulations to Jett and others in the lab for [their new paper in Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55214-w) introducing evaluation metrics, a gold-standard  dataset, and a new probabilistic machine learning method to help infer single-cell expression profiles from multiplexed imaging datasets in the presence of segmentation errors.
