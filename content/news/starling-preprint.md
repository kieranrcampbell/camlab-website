Our preprint on STARLING - a new method for clustering highly multiplexed imaging data  while accounting for segmentation errors - is now [up on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582827v1) along with a corresponding [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kieranrcampbell/status/1765025365691417009).
