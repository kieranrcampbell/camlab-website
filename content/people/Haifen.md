Then she went to Singapore to pursue her Ph.D in Computational Biology, at Nanyang Technological University. With her Ph.D degree, she moved to Montreal Canada in October 2016 as a postdoctoral fellow in the Majewski lab, where she focused on the analysis of next generation sequencing data (e.g. ChIP/RNA-seq, WGBS) to uncover the crosstalk of epigenetic modifications and its impact on chromatin landscape and gene expression leading to cell fate decisions in tumorigenesis. Haifen recently joined the Campbell Lab at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute to embark on an exciting journey in single-cell analysis!" twitter = "" github = "Hephen" linkedin = "Haifen Chen" email = "hchen@lunenfeld.ca" date = 2023-05-09 +++
