biography = "Kai Yang earned his Honours BSc in Mathematics and Statistics and an MSc in Statistics from McMaster University. He subsequently completed his PhD in Biostatistics at McGill University, where his dissertation bridged mathematics and statistical physics theory with turnkey software implementations and real-world applications --- developing computationally efficient numerical algorithms and robust machine learning methods for high-dimensional, large-scale datasets, exemplified by UK Biobank SNP arrays and ABIDE neuroimaging cohorts. As a Postdoctoral Fellow, he designs sophisticated deep-learning architectures for genetic dependency prediction, aiming at constructing the most comprehensive synthetic-lethal interaction atlas to date and delivering computational models that yield immediately testable experimental hypotheses."
