biography = "Alina received a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of York, UK. She then earned an MSc in Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics from the University of Edinburgh, UK, where she investigated functional hippocampal-cortical connectivity. Following this, Alina completed her PhD at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. During her PhD studies, she developed machine learning methods for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data focusing on RNA biology, e.g. RNA secondary structure and RNA-protein interactions. In 2019, Alina started her postdoctoral training in the lab of Dr. Quaid Morris at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute. Alina's postdoctoral work involved segmentation methods for copy number inference from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, linking genotype and phenotype in tumour cells. Currently, Alina is a postdoctoral fellow in Campbell Lab at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute and is working on automatic machine learning methods for recommending optimal workflows for scRNA-seq analysis."
