The Campbell Lab works on a diverse set of problems at the intersection of machine learning and biomedical research. We are based in Toronto's Discovery District at the 
[Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute of Sinai Health System](http://www.lunenfeld.ca/researchers/campbell)
and the Departments of [Molecular Genetics](http://www.moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/) and [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

We work on many things including:
* Machine learning models for spatial 'omics data
* Understanding the composition and dynamics of the tumour microenvironment and how it enables tumour progression
* Machine learning algorithms to help automate biological and biomedical data analysis
* Software development for the design and analysis of highly multiplexed imaging datasets
